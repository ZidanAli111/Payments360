    "zellepassage": " Terms of service documentI am a little late to the game here but there is an alternative and shorter way to do it if you're mainly interested in making intellisense work.You can extend the base class and then redeclare the members you want to omit as private. This will generate a typescript error ignore will clear it up and shouldn't affect compilation.This is my preferred way to do it when things are simple. No real overhead here or challenging type syntax. The only real downside here is that adding  above the extending class could prevent you from receiving other error messages related to incorrectly extending the Base class. The one advantage to this approach over the accepted pickConstructor approach is that this method doesn't generate any extra code. Whereas pickConstructor literally exists as a function after compilation that runs during class definition.",
